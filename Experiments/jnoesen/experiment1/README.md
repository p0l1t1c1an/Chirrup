# Experiment 1: Light/Dark Toggle
For my first experiment, which is also my first time making a GUI with android, I made a simple application with a toggle button that toggles the activity between a light and dark theme. Tapping the button will cause all elements on screen to fade to either white or black smoothly.

### What I got out of this experiment
- How to create an android project
- How to add elements to an activity
- How to reference the elements in the Java code
- How to modify elements in an activity
- How to handle button presses
