# Experiment 2: Multiple Pages
For my second experiment, I made a quick app that has three pages and a flyout menu to switch between them. The first page just has text on it, the second page shows the current date and time with live updates, and the third page has a counter on it.

### What I got out of this experiment
- How to use the openable layout to switch between pages
- How to manage multiple pages
- How to edit icons and labels for layouts
- How to get the current date and time for the API version we're using
