# Experiment 3: Chat Scrolling
For my third experiment, I made a quick app that generates messages that get put into a scrolling activity. This is similar to a chat app where messages come in and you are able to scroll through them.

### What I got out of this experiment
- How to add text views to a layout within the Java code
- How to manage scrolling and vertical layouts
- How to use a text input box
- How to essentially make a simple messaging interface
