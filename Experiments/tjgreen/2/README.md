# Experiment 2: Create a new repository and finish linking two repositories
In this experiment, I will complete the linking of two repositories, and also add a method in springboot to find entries in a table

### What I learned
- How two tables can be linked using another table
- How to add custom find methods to a repository that spring boot can parse
