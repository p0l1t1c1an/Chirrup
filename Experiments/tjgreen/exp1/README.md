# Experiment 1: Create a new repository and link two repositories
In this experiment, I attempted adding a new repository like the PeopleRepository but with a different name and table entries. I then made another repository to try and link a person to a server, starting a way to keep track of who belongs to what server.

### What I learned
- How to set up a spring boot project in VS Code
- How to make routes from different pages
- How to make a POST and GET request using git bash
- How to commit to GIT
