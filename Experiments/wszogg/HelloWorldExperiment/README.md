****This experiment is a modified version of Hello World:****
- The main activity asks the user to enter their name
- When the user clicks 'submit', a new activity is opened
- The new activity says hello to the user, and there is a back button
This experiment was very helpful for learning how to create several activities and 
link them together using 'intent'.
