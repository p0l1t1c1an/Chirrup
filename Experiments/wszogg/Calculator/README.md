****Experiment 3: Calculator****
- The point of this experiment was to design a simple application where the visuals
are very important
- This calculator app is about experimenting with creating user-friendly interfaces
- The calculator may not be fully functional in the end as the enter function 
can be very complicated

After completing this experiment, I have discovered the importance of creating user interfaces that are 
very easy to navigate with little to no tutorial.
