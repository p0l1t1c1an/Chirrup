# Chirrup

## About
Chirrup is a simple, twitter-esque social media application with built-in parental features to allow parents to keep their children safe. The front end is written for Android, and the backend uses SpringBoot to work how it does.

## Purpose
This project was created as part of Com S 309 at Iowa State University, which is a course about software development practices. This is not intended to be used by the general public, rather, this was a project used to get in the habit of certain software development practices through a large, semester long project. Due to this, a lot of features implemented are not done as they would be in reality.
